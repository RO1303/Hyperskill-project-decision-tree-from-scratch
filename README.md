This is the *Decision Tree from Scratch* project I made myself.


<p>A decision tree is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms due to its ease of interpretation. This algorithm is similar to the way we make decisions in our daily life.<br>
In this project, you will take a closer look at the algorithm and write it from scratch with the help of Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Teach the model to process categorical and numerical features to make data-based decisions. Implement a decision tree for classification and apply it to a real dataset.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/259?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/259</a>
